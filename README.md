# 🧠✨ Depression Analysis Dashboard: A No-Cap Deep Dive into Mental Health Insights ✨🧠

Yo, fam! 👋 Welcome to the **Depression Analysis Dashboard**, where we’re serving up some *serious vibes* about mental health using data science and interactive viz (short for visualizations, duh). This project is all about breaking down complex stats into easy-to-understand charts, graphs, and sliders so you can vibe with the data like a pro. 

Whether you’re a data nerd, a mental health advocate, or just someone curious about how stuff works, this dashboard has got something for everyone. Let’s get into it! 🚀

## 🌟 What’s the Tea? (aka What’s This Project About?)

This dashboard is designed to help you explore insights about depression through **interactive visualizations**. Using Python, Plotly, and Pandas, we’ve created a dope tool that lets you:

- Analyze distributions of key factors like **CGPA**, **age**, **sleep duration**, and more.
- Compare how different variables (like **academic pressure**, **dietary habits**, or **family history**) relate to depression levels.
- Slide into insights with **sliders** to filter data dynamically. Swipe left or right on the slider to see how thresholds affect the results—no cap!
- Get the full picture with a **correlation heatmap** that shows how numeric variables are connected.

It’s lit, trust me. 🔥
